The surgeon quite literally sticks a little tube through the ear drum to regulate pressure, drain infection, etc. They get removed eventually and the ear drum heals over. We can sometimes see the scarring on the ear drum on examination. Super interesting to speech/hearing nerds like me!",

I was playing Valorant with a friend and a guy starts being toxic to her even tho she is top fragging. I tell him to stfu. He responds with \"you are beneath me. Don't talk.\" And he was right. So I honor the code.  And preced to climb the board and out frag him. When I pass him I continue to then speak my mind and tell him he's bad, I won't ever care about him and he can lick the dirt mound I stand above him on. Spite makes people do incredible things! :)",
